# AgriEquipConnect


Problem Statement:

Farmer Side Problem:
Farmers often face challenges in accessing and affording high-quality agricultural machinery, which affects their productivity and efficiency. There is a need for a convenient, reliable, and cost-effective solution to access agricultural equipment.

Owner Side Problem:
Owners face the risk of dishonest behavior by hired drivers, who may misreport hours worked, misuse machinery, or engage in fuel theft. This lack of transparency and accountability leads to financial losses and erodes trust between owners and drivers.

Brief about the idea:
AgriEquip Connect is a digital platform that allows farmers to book and rent agricultural machinery such as harvesters, tractors, drones, cultivators, and rotovators. The platform aims to improve accessibility and affordability, enhancing the overall efficiency of agricultural operations.

Implementing a real-time tracking system for machinery usage addresses the issue by providing owners with accurate data on equipment operation. This system monitors the hours worked, fuel consumption, and location of the machinery, ensuring that drivers use the equipment as intended. By offering detailed reports and alerts for any discrepancies, the tracking system enhances transparency, prevents misuse, and helps owners avoid financial losses, thereby building trust between owners and drivers.
